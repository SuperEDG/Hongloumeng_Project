# Data Directory README

This directory contains all the raw and processed data used in this project.

## Directory Structure

The data directory is organized into two main subdirectories:

### Resources

This directory contains the original, unprocessed datasets, which serve as the starting point for generating high-quality dialogue datasets.

It includes three subdirectories:

- `Books`: This folder contains the original literary works in `.txt` format.
  
- `chineseTraits`: This folder contains three `.txt` files from different sources: C-LIWC and Tsinghua University's Positively and Negatively Charged Word Library.
  
- `Reviews`: This folder contains various reviews of the characters in the novel.

### Processed

This directory contains the datasets generated by the framework. 

It includes the following:

- `books`: This folder contains two types of JSON files. One type contains dialogues extracted from the original literary works. The dialogues are stored in a dictionary format with the keys: `istart`, `iend`, `talk`, and `context`. Here `talk` refers to the content enclosed by the quotation marks, `context` refers to the speaking character's context, and `istart` and `iend` represent the position in the original book data. The second type of JSON files contains reviews structured as a dictionary with keys: `Name`, `Reviews`, and `Source`. `Name` refers to the name of the character being reviewed, `Reviews` contains all the review texts, and `Source` indicates the source of the reviews.

- `Component1-Lexicon`: This folder contains `chineseTraits.json`, which is the Chinese personality lexicon built for this project.

- `Component2-NER`: This folder contains data for the Named Entity Recognition (NER) task. The `.txt` files with 'bio' in their names are datasets annotated in the BIO format, which have undergone data augmentation. The generated dialogues are stored in `.csv` format, with one column for the name and another for the dialogue content.

- `Component3-LCPM`: This folder contains the generated Literary Character Personality Maps (LCPM).

This organized data structure helps in better understanding and navigation of the dataset and contributes to the reproducibility of the project.
